# Distro-Hopping-Scripts
A series of bash scripts I'm using as i embark on my Linux nomad journey so that i dont have to install a bunch of things every time.

# These scripts are intended to be more of a framework than static scripts, change whatever packages you want to install or whatever image/files you want to wget

# Alpine System
Made for any system that use the APK package manager

# Debian System
Predictably, made for any systems that use the APT package manager

# Gentoo System
This is a script is specifically for the sickos out there that use Gentoo's Portage package manager

# openSUSE System
This script is made for any system that uses the zypper package manager

# RedHat System
Made for systems that use the dnf package manager

# Void System
Made for any system that uses the xbps package manager

# Yay Installer
An install script for the AUR Pacman wrapper yay

# Unified Installer
The Unified Installer rolls all of the above scripts into one shell script that is easy to use and understand
